**Box-Stream**

**Description:**

Box-Stream is a simple web application that allows users to fetch and stream videos from TERRA-BOX URLs. With a clean and user-friendly interface, it provides an easy way to watch videos directly from online sources bypassing all the ADS.

**Key Features:**

- Fetch Video Link: Enter the URL of a video and click the "Fetch Video Link" button to load and stream the video.
- Play and Download: Once the video link is fetched, you can play the video instantly or download it for offline viewing.
- Backend Service: The application uses the [BoxStream backend service](https://boxstream.thejuniortest.workers.dev) to fetch video links.

Box-Stream is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it easy to host and use for streaming videos from the web.
